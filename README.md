### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to implement complex financial formulas to calculate repayment schedules accurately, as well as how to manage user input efficiently using React and TypeScript. I also improved my skills in designing an intuitive UI that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring accessibility and clarity for all users.

### Useful resources

- [Vite Documentation](https://vite.dev/guide/) - This is the Vite documentation page, which is what I used to develop this application. In there, I was able to gather and search all the information that I needed to succeed in this challenge.
- [TailwindCSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode) - This is by far my preferred CSS framework to style my applications. I used the guide to enable the dark mode feature.
- [React Hook Form Documentation](https://react-hook-form.com/) - I was impressed by how easy React Hook Form makes working with forms. It was a great help in capturing the information entered in the different form fields.
